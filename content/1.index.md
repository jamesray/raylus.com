üíô **Currently,** I'm focused on contributing to the NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) Luna project as a contractor with Navteca, where I support the development as a Sr. DevOps Engineer.

üöÄ **Previously** [Jet Propulsion Lab](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/) in Pasadena, CA, where I played a key role in building a cohesive ecosystem for NASA's various products, including the refinement of jpl.nasa.gov (Wagtail-Django/Nuxt) and science.nasa.gov (WordPress).
