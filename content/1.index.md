💙 **Thrilled** to be at the [Jet Propulsion Lab](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/) in Pasadena, CA, where I've played a key role in building a cohesive ecosystem for NASA's various products, including the refinement of jpl.nasa.gov (Wagtail-Django/Nuxt2) and beta.science.nasa.gov (WordPress/Nuxt3). Our hard work was recognized with the 2022 NASA Agency Honor Awards.

🛰 **Always Learning** - My commitment to staying abreast of the latest tech trends and engaging in community discussions fuels my daily routine. Balancing design and engineering in web development is a core value of mine.
